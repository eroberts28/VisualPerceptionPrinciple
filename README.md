# Visual Perception Principles

## Closure

With closure, we  combine parts to form a simpler whole. Our eye fills in the missing information to form the complete figure.
Closure.

In the left image above, you should see a white triangle even though the image is actually comprised of three black Pac-Man-like shapes. On the right image, you see a panda even though the figure is several random shapes. Seeing the triangle and panda is simpler than trying to make sense of the individual parts.

Closure can be thought of as the glue holding elements together. It’s about the human tendency to seek and find patterns.
The key to closure is providing enough information so the eye can fill in the rest. If too much is missing, the elements will be seen as separate parts instead of a whole. If too much information is provided, there’s no need for closure to occur.

Another famous example of closure within design is the FedEx logo. When you look closer at the logo you can see inbetween the 'E' and the 'x' an arrow which they have use to represent what they do as a delivery service.

## Symmetry

Symmetry gives us a feeling of solidity and order, which we tend to seek. It’s our nature to impose order on chaos. This principle leads us to want balance in composition, though our compositions don’t need to be perfectly symmetrical to be in balance.

In the image above, you should see three pairs of opening and closing brackets. The principle of proximity, which we’ll get to later in this post, might suggest we should see something else. That suggests symmetry takes precedence over proximity.
Since our eyes will quickly find symmetry and order, these principles can be used to effectively communicate information quickly.
